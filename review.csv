1607,"Overall product is okay from value for money perspective.
However, lot of not needed apps (bloatware) which we cannot remove and also samsung installs some unwanted apps while providing updates. Doesn't look good for samsung to make money this way.",3
1608,Camera is really Sad Would suggest please do not go for this cellphone if Camera is priority at this price point you have other Realme and Motorola phone which you should have your eyes on.Purchased keeping 5g bands in mind.Smasung should really work on camera for this price range.,3
1609,"Camera is worst. Reminds of days we used 3-5MP phones. Same to be said about the screen - Paying 17k to get a TFT is unpardonable. Only good thing is battery - great performance. But charging takes insanely long - 2hrs almost for 100%.

The reason i went with this is to get a Samsung phone, as our company syncs email only for Samsung/iPhone. If no such compulsion, please save your money and don't buy this.",2

Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT
Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation.

Little heavy and thick than others but best in this price range. Rear and front cameras are superb.

6000 mah battery is just wow. Power packed phone.

As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage.

‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

Definitely the battery. It's real good
Display looks good.
No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly
Back camera is good.

Cons:
Selfie camera could ve been better. As Mi phones offer good camera quality for this price range

4856,it's not very good but battery is good processor is not very good so if we have to do gaming then it is not better for us,1
4857,I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good. Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.,5
4858,Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .,4
4859,"Display is waste even less budget phones of other brands compared to this have good display.....camera says 48mp but trust me it's not even 8mp camera also.....speaker volume is less...... never expected this from a brand like samsung....... samsung manufacturers the display and supply to all other brands but Samsung itself should work on his phones rather....... totally bad experience.
Please go for any other brand......if u buy this phone simply u will not satisfy.",1

4863,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.,4
4864,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
4865,It is very very nice and it's is Battery preformance is awesome it can for 3days and it performance of the chip inside super more faster .camera also good .,5

I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5
4869,Good option for normal users. It will be good if a back case is provided along with the package. 6000mah battery might not as good as others. But for a Samsung phone this is the best option. Quad camera set is is just okay. Macro shots and all are just average. But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range. The display is fine. Much brighter and clearer one. The phone is little bulky but it won't be a problem for us. For gamers you may skip this phone. This is not ...,5

Handling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case
Good build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress

Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.

Pros:
1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage
2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use.

Advantage

1. Best performance in this segment after poco x3 pro

2. Good display if you are using Full Hd+ but you have used amoled display you may be little bit sad however, full hd+ more natural color than amoled display if you want to feel.

3. 33W charger it may take time around 1 hour so it is good option to charge immediately and use again.

4. Brightness good

Best gaming laptop under 55k without a doubt
It comes with a simple design so it doesn't look like a normal gaming laptop.Battery is good.

Only con I noticed is with the colour of the display some colours are not so perfect but it is not a con which makes us difficult to use the lap and it can't be noticed easily

14"" display looks compact and handling is easy unlike bulky 15.6"" displays. 2 high speed USB slots, 1 regular USB slot, 1 HDMI slot, 1 LAN cable slot, 1 SD memory card slot and 3.5 mm earphone slot provide lots of options. Dua...",5

Only cons
1. Battery : it is not much efficient, draining quite fast i f you running the fan at high speed and doing tasks.
2. Hinge - Its not super sturdy. In case of a light movement, the screen will wobble a bit. But if your task is more on stable surface, its good to go.

Apart from it, i would say everything is fantastic. Go for it.",5

7160,The laptop is great and can provide a maximum of 144 fps even with a 3050 rtx because of other limitations. The web cam is not that good but so if you need to attend calls with this then probably not the best choice. For gaming purposes although it's good but it often heats upto 55-70¬∞ during gaming.,4

Pros
1. Great display, 144hz really brings out the crispness in image quality

3. i5 10500H is powerful processors and can handle all games easily

Its common for gaming laptops
Go for it",5
7312,"It's a good product, you can go for it. This laptop is value for money, except that the battery drains out fast, but, I guess that's common in gaming laptops. The look is premium and there's no doubt in it's performance.",4
7313,Good laptop with all basic needs for a gamer and graphic designs.. Battery life is OK. Performance and multitasking is good. Nice design and weight is also less for a gaming laptop. Backlit is lit!,4
7314,"The laptop overall is very good . Loved it . But the product i recieved from flipkart at first had scratches on it‚Äôs power button and i got the product replaced . The second time also there is minor scratch on the power vutton a single line. Overall happy with the product , just the one issue with the scratch so 4 star.",4

60 fps in High settings in Forza and other games

Cons- 2 usb ports only
Speakers are awfully had.",5
7329,I like the product much interms of speed but Sound is not good 3/5 i expected a loud volume. Fan Noise is irritating when it runs to cool your pc during high usage. Battery pickup is around 4-5 yrs on normal usage. it catches finger prints on surface which is irritating. Touchpad is average. It should have been supplied with a wireless mouse.,5

Everything good except cons.

Cons:
1. Battery - it drains drastically in a matter of time even if you are watching movie or something.
2. Screen - it has pretty mediocre screen although it has an IPS 1080p panel. Low brightness.

If you compromise on these do consider buying this laptop.",5

Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm.

Having 2 lenses & carrying them are essential steps to take desired photos.

And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend. If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.",5

Honestly speaking I wanted to buy 700d, then 750d, then 800d, then 200d then finally got 200d Mark II. (Just understand the feeling, don't use too much logic here)

So basically speaking, waited a lot, explored a lot, then finally spent a lot and for this one.

I can take sharp photos seamlessly.

I am not quite satisfied with it's low-light performance. Both the kit lenses are not that great for low light. You'll either need to increase the ISO sensitivity or the shutter speed and in either ways the image won't be that great.

The overall performance is great and I'm planning to take more and more pictures.",4

Attached is a Sam photo taken after sunset with lowest daylight condition. There are more sample photos to be taken, I will upload more in the coming days.",5

And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend. If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.",5

Honestly speaking I wanted to buy 700d, then 750d, then 800d, then 200d then finally got 200d Mark II. (Just understand the feeling, don't use too much logic here)

So basically speaking, waited a lot, explored a lot, then finally spent a lot and for this one.

I can take sharp photos seamlessly.

I am not quite satisfied with it's low-light performance. Both the kit lenses are not that great for low light. You'll either need to increase the ISO sensitivity or the shutter speed and in either ways the image won't be that great.

The overall performance is great and I'm planning to take more and more pictures.",4

Overall sound and build quality is nice for a branded product in this price range with Soft ear cushions.
Cons:
During phone calls there is a minor echo like effect on our side and not in the other end but for me I don't feel it as a serious con but that depends on everyone's personal preference.

9319,One Star. Sony name stands for quality of sound. However the experience I was expecting out of the product was not there. I went for a refund and it was rejected. The reason I provided was that the sound is low than my expectation from Sony product as i own multiple products from Sony. Somehow Flipkart felt that it is not a reason for refund & rejected the same. Hence it seems ones dissatisfaction for the product is not sufficient reason. Flipkart lost one customer.,1

Sounds are really amazing

I will re edit again after 20days
Design, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.
No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.

Nice one... Good ...",5
9798,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios.
I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up.
But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???",2
9799,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience,1

9802,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ...",4

Review after 5days of heavy usage
First thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.

The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..

I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus.

9837,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage.

9887,"Let me tell you very simple review.

1. Most Important is Sound Quality : 3.5/5
What you are getting at price of Rs. 1200 (+/- 200 depending on offers), you are getting fair sound quality..nothing is very good or nothing is bad..

Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore.",3

Okay. I don't know why I was thinking it would be a bit larger in size. But all and all, a really good product. BOAT never Disappoints.

Sound is also nice but bass is not enough ..",5
10044,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:
1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.
2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it.
3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look.",5

First thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.
The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.
The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..

I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus.

10093,"I have been using it for over 3 months now. My priority is to take calls. Usage - 80% Official calls, 20% regular stuff. I am writing this review after using different brands TWS. I have segregated my points:
1. I took it for my office calls as it gives flexibility to move around during lengthy calls. The sound quality is very good. Crisp and clear voice. The caller on the other side doesnt even come to know that we are using bluetooth device instead of wired headphones.
2. Sound quality is v...",5
10094,"Should include switch button to switch between devices. The first time a used this, the sound quality was premium . earlier I was using boat rockerz 245. Yes there is bass to but for maximum effect you have to maximize the volume and you can't stay in this for long then . You Ave to adjust volume and equalisers. Magnetic on/off works very good .",4
10095,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side. And low latency mode best in this price range...even with a non-Oneplus device( I've a Samsung phone ). Overall valu...",4
10096,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.,5
10097,"This is my second OnePlus Bullets bass edition. Before I used normal edition. I am very much satisfied with this. Best battery backup I got ever, it give 5 to 7 days of backup. Thanks for Best Latency for playing Pubg and other games. I suggest everyone to just try this for once. Thanks OnePlus Never Settle.",4
10098,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.,4
10099,Buy without any second thought just bought it and the sound quality is pretty darn good the bass is also good but not as punchy as realmebuds wireless but the bass is present and it's awesome the balanced sound quality is op,4

VOCALS AND SOUND QUALITY are simply superb you can here even the smallest sounds very clearly and BASS is good but it's not very much high.
Build Quality is very good you can use it for hours and won't even feel them they are light and material quality is good.

10105,This product is very good product. Best sound quality. Best battery backup... So I like this product,5
10106,One thing I tell you that it has high bass. Bass lover will love it. But non bass Love it is headache. But sound quality and build quality is outstanding.,3
10107,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.,4
10108,"Awesome experience after 1 week
Battery backup super Awesome
Very nice product",5
10109,"Best and Best Bluetooth Neck Band Headset.
It's all in one package. It's look so nice. Build quality amazing. It's like a rubber. It's so comfortable. Battery backup is awesome. Balanced sound decent bass. Better call quality. It's one plus the brand is enough. Main Features is pairing technology. It's magnetic. If u join them sound or call is automatically off that nice and also for power saving . When u differ the buds It's automatically and fast connected to call or music.
Go for it. Do...",5
10110,OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear. Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.,5
10111,"PROS
* Sound quality
*Good bass better than previous bullets
*Battery backup is good
*Comfortable neckband
*You can listen each and every instrument sound clearly
*Call quality is good
*Noise cancellation is not better we can expect it
*Stylish and simple
CONS
*Noise cancellation is not good
*Eartips are made in plastic so we can listen low bass
*call quality is good and some noise we can observe
*Latency is ok not good at all
*High sound makes some noise and we can miss crystal clear sound",4
10112,After comparison with all neckband I bought this. It was great experience with oneplus. Bass is awesome. You need not to make full volume for deep bass. It shows it‚Äôs class with smaller volume also. Easy pairing. Easy play pause.,5
10113,"Excellent product, but the batter back up is not that much impressive..but Excellent sounds and music.really they have worked up with the bass..built quality is really good.worth every penny...",5
10114,"Bass is not that smooth nor a destroyer to the ears. It is a blend of decent bass.
I dont like the bass performance but the overall make, fit and finish is good. Built Quality is good. The higher variant of the Oneplus Wireless Bullets 2 are way too good than this product in terms of sound and quality.

At this price point of Rs. 1799, this is not the best product. It sounds like a Rs. 1000 product which are also available on flipkart with different branding.",3
10115,"I have recently purchase this OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition from flipkart. The quality is very good, it look and feel very premium in hand. After using this for a week now I can say that it is best value for money.

Pros :-
Premium build quality
Nice battery backup


Cons :-
Sound can be a bit more clear
Price should be around 1500.


Thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery of this product at this difficult time. I am very satisfied with service and offers provided by flipkart. flipkart...",5
10116,"Super delivery within one day. Thaks for the filpkart delivery. Best value for price. Durable product. If u looking for a standard bluetooth headset, then go for it",4
10117,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.,3
10118,"review after my 1 week usage.
Sound quality is good, battery also good charge for 20 minutes can use for 15 +hours.. Build quality also good...

10119,"My first OnePlus product .I must say this product stands out in delivering good quality mids , highs and lows .I never expected that bass level as I am a bass lover myself and have sony XM4 . This pair of earphones from OnePlus is better than Boat in terms of quality and hardware in this price range.I have not tried realme wireless neckband but definitely the wireless bass z edition is a tough competition to these companies. I have used Boat 225 bluetooth neckband but this one is much better...",5
10120,Awesome looking and stylish all my friends are asking me for testing this product and some of them are buying. that's batter and I like that thing. Also the phone has low latency mode that's also help me in game overall good performance. Must buy ü§ó,5
10121,happy For Good Service provided by flipkart..! Product is very good and having good Battery life..! Go for it in offer o got in Rs. 1699/-,5
10122,"One of the best headphones .I have ever used
Sound quality is ok , if are a bass lover just go for it
Otherwise for sound quality u may choose JBL or Sony xdr series headphone , this headphone has the best build quality , battery backup is stunning
From my view I will give 95/100 points",5
10123,"ONEPLUS has done an excellent job.
exceptional earphone with EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY, EXCELLENT BASS, EXCELLENT CALL QUALITY & EXCELLENT COMFORT...
The final thing is battery... It's excellent in my words.I got more than 12 hours of battery backup throughout 3 days with more than 6 hours of calling. One more additional thing is that it can be charged within 50 minutes to 100% and 10 minutes of charging gives more than 60% of charge.
FINAL VERDICT : GO FOR IT BLINDLY",5
10124,"The build quality is Good
Charging time and battery backup is excellent.
The sound quality is good but the sound clarity is not like a Rs2000 earphone",3
10125,Product is good but as the name says baas edition it has not such a good bass but its decent sound quality is good but bass is not so satisfying,3
10126,"Easy to carry. Best sound quality. Strong sensor. Water proof
In one word just wow",5
10127,"Good connectivity, battery backup and build quality. Sound quality is so average, definitely not as good as my boat rockers 255. Useful for office work, attending calls or listening to lectures. A big no for listening to music.",3
10128,"Last version of one plus eaephones was more technologically advanced, this one has got all the good features except for the swap switch where just by pressing the button i could pair with different devices.
Not so happy with it, also the battery back up is less compared to previous version of this.
However its not that great nor is it too bad.
Nothing so cool, its similar to realme or mi earphones.",3
10129,"hello, If you're 1+ Bullets wireless Z Bass user mean... You can hear opponents voice very well even if you ride bike. But Opponents didn't hear your voice when u ride bike and in travelling. Otherwise it's one of the best in this price.. Bass is powerful and Good.",3
10130,"Amazing product it is perfect wireless earphone in under 2000/ rupees price.
Pros
1) perfect bit and bass ...sound quality is best
2) very fast charge 20% to 100% only 15 minutes taken.
3) I was 1 hour planning music in 100% charge there is
no decrease charging...... that's great.
4) long lasting battery
5) very fast connectivity and approx 12m there is no
problem of connectivity.
6) build quality and looking nice.

Con
There is ...",5
10131,"Evry thing is all right but belive me guys it cant overtake boat headphones or realme wireless bud 2..... I have these all.....
Here they named bass edition . But if u use boat and realme you never use this one.....but sound detail is very good.....you can listen evey minute instruments sounds.....


And the very importet point of this headphone is. The best bluetooth neck band for pubg....no one can beat this one in case of pubg .....so if u are a pubg lover and no headphone jack dont worry ...",5
10132,"Actually this is the earphones that once I dreamt of. Now I got this and I am really really was excited about this.The sound quality is so far the best in the segment and the reengineered bass is so sick.The battery pack up has no issues cause it supports warp charging, so 10 minutes is crazy fast. And the built quality has been always better with one plus.So I am fully satisfied",5
10133,"Very good product and good quality, sound quality is very impressive bass and stereo equal tuneing, totally amazing product
Flipkart delivery is very decent and very waiting for this product just 15 hours only",5
10134,Product is great. Gets charge quickly and last for long. Sound and built quality is best within this price range. Not recommended for gamers though as letency is high. Great for watching movies or listening to music. Only problem is in calling. I have to keep left on ear and on right side hanging as it brings mic closer to mouth so that other end can hear the call clearly. If not than other end often complains about not hearing my voice clearly while using this earphone.,5
10135,"Excellent product, nice bass, loud and clear sound, amazing comfort, super build quality and excellent battery backup... Worth the money.",5
10136,"This is very good headphone AFAIK. It takes only 10mins to charge 80% (any charger which supports quick charge can be used, i used my poco 18W charger) which is sufficient for 10hrs usage. It takes 1hr to reach 100% charge.
Battery life is fantastic i got around 15 to 16hrs. Volume is too high so can't go over 50%. Build quality looks nice, feels sturdy and the cable is braided. The fit is comfortable and Weightless. Sound quality is above average. Yeah bass is present. Call quality is excell...",5
10137,The build quality of the earphone is very good sound is awsme bass is good enough it will not hurt your ear battery backup is awsme so overall product is very good,5
10138,"Sound quality is good, the bass thump is great! Instrument separation, sound clarity and soundstage is above average at this price point. The main highlight is the battery life. I have been using it for 2 weeks now, and it lasts around 15 hours on single full charge, and takes only 10 min to get charged to 70 80 % which indeed gives battery backup as claimed for 9 to 10 hrs. It also is somewhat on the comfortable side and very lightweight. Overall a great product considering the price point.",5
10139,Awesome Quality Nice Sound & Bass I M Happy With This Product Thank You So Much One Plus & Flipkart,5
10140,Battery backup is good. Charging speed also very fast. Not best but good sound quality. Worth for price. I am enjoying the product,5
10141,Dont look only brand value. Good but not worthy for 1999. Go for any other like boat or something else.,3
10142,Sound quality is decent bass is below average you don't expect bass like headphone. Best part about your earphone fast charging and battery backup just 15 minute charge and you're good to go for 10 to 12 hours,5
10143,"I liked everything about this bluetooth.

call quality - Superb (everywhere)
sound quality - very good
battery backup - very good ( easily 2 days for normal users and for heavy users easily 1 day with 20% power left)

3 ear tips provided and one type C charging cable with this.
mterial quality used is very good and flexible...",5
10144,The collar and wire quality is good. Battery back up is bang on I mean I'm using it in my day to day calls and videos and it easily work for 8-10 hours on heavy usage. One thing that is missing is quick switch. I'm using the OP buds as well and quick switch on them works like magic to switch between devices.,4
10145,I have purchased OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition Red recently and it is very useful. Red Color looks very premium. Quality of the product is also very good. I am very satisfied with the service. And as always thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery of the product. Flipkart as always is my favorite online store and provides with best service every time.,5

10390,"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.
Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.
Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.",5
10391,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" üòÑüòÑüòâ",5
10392,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.,4
10393,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great üëå and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great,5
10394,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedback
Bass : 10/10
Clarity : 9/10
Comfort ease n looks : 15/10
Features :10/10

The best buy from flipkart yet..",5

10399,"This headphone is good but not that much as i expected
*Pros- 1Good battery backup
2Good sound quality

*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointed

Overall not good
Don't buy please",1

The earphones does not perfectly fit in my ear , and falls often
Battery backup is very good , approx 8 hours for me in one charge
Connectivity is good
Call quality is also good , I feel no distubance in talking , even while walking I could finely hear the voices ...",4

10472,"Very sexy in look wise ... Awesome in this price range but boult audio curve is better option , good base and battery backup ..",4
10473,"Reasons to buy -

1) Premium Build quality

2) Samsung eco system and better compatibility with samsung smartphones.

3) If you value Samsung branding.

4) It's very light weight and comfortable and I didn't find any issues with fitting.

Reasons to avoid -

1) Better than average sound quality => in my opinion Airpods 2 are better in terms of sound signature and I would prefer Airpods only for sound signature but samsung has PNC due to it's design language and ANC too so the sound may feel ...",3
10474,"A very decent product i must say, if you are a tech lover & is looking forward for a decent product comprising of all the features prevailing in current tws's then defenitly it will satisfy you more than anything. Call clarity is good.
If you are a hardcore music lover who's lookn for high bass & crisp instrumentals than it will disappoint you as the sound here is rich & balanced in every possible way.",4
10475,"2 days of use- Amazing product. Good sound quality, good connectivity, design is awesome, fits good in my ear. ANC is awesome too. Working amazing with my galaxy phone. Just that it starts hurting after sometime. It has missed voice during calls 2 times, maybe Samsung will rectify it with updates

Review on 18th October- after use i felt that these keep coming out of ear and sometimes the sound in both ears has lag and vary.",3
10476,"Samsung has nailed it with another TWS product. Superb sound quality, Easy to use app for connectivity and with very important set of features. And if having a galaxy phone it would be useful and productive to be in the galaxy ecosystem..",5
10477,Sound is good as its from akg and latest gen samsung.. but touch controls are not very easy and if u pick up call from phone the call transfer to phone instead of bluetooth. 1 month of using it.. still havent figured out to pickup calls on it easily.. miss my jabra for fit and ease of connection.,3

Pros: Build quality, clear sound, Lightweight, branded product at low price, perfect fitting, insta wake up technology Good bass and sound(by using other music players mentioned below)
Cons: Low bass which can control by other music players like Google play music, Dub music player or third party equaliser app. You will get perfect sound by playing music on this players.",4
10577,Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.,5

10584,"Ok
Updated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.
Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.
Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.",3
10585,"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.

I must say at this price point the product is quite good.

Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.

Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.

Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is.",4
10586,"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price. Never go for boat airdopes 131 as this is just good in look and WORST in performance. Could have given 0 star if available in option.",1

First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound quality
A decent bass
A nice battery backup
But it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.
My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.
You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.
Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...
Just go for it",5

1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.
2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it.
3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look.",5

The quality of the DuoPods are awesome, one should really get their hands on it.",5

The sound is very clear.
The touch responsive.
The bass is little less.
You must remember that it's a earbud not a over ear head phone
To get a huge bass you must buy a headphone not earphone.

Mivi Duopods M20 is a probably the best if it is priced at 1900.

The bass in this Duopods is sufficient , a good stereo sound can be experienced.",5

10756,"Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day",5
10757,Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money,5
10758,"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.
Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.
Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.",5
10759,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" üòÑüòÑüòâ",5
10760,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.,4
10761,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great üëå and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great,5
10762,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedback
Bass : 10/10
Clarity : 9/10
Comfort ease n looks : 15/10
Features :10/10

The best buy from flipkart yet..",5

10767,"This headphone is good but not that much as i expected
*Pros- 1Good battery backup
2Good sound quality

*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointed

Overall not good
Don't buy please",1
10768,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating),3

10784,It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue. That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides.

Pros:
1. The sound is excellent.
2. wire is enough long.
3. 3.5mm jack makes it good fr any smartphone.

5. It has an premium look.
Cons:

Download a decent equalizer and you are all set.
Last but not least ,awesome delivery by flipkart.",4
11305,"it's a decent product from boat, decent bass treble is good .
if you want to buy a earphone that explodes with bass don't go for this one, but if you want clear punch and drums sound..than you should definitely buy this as its bass doesn't blend with treble and ruin the quality...
overall nice product if you'll consider the price also",5

Design is very good that it will not slip from my ear (so far sennheiser cx 275s is the only headset which gave me this comfort while wearing). Sound is loud and clear.

11322,Just like any another earphones. Bass is not that special as said. Bass is normal like you get in any other normal earphone. It was a disspointment as they said this is a bass special. Now only thing that will determine if these are good is the time. If they survived for 1 year without any fault then I will say they are good otherwise they are bad cause there is nothing special in this earphone.,1

If you combine the sound and bass of the earphone, the sound is very low, and bass I kinda cool. if u wanna here some mass songs in this earphone or watch some action trailers in this earphone you'll be disappointed coz it only has bass.

11390,These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.,2

About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving.

Overall not good
Don't buy please",1

11670,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily.",4

Will recommend buying boat instead of mivi,4

Battery life : Good. But for the size of the neckband, you wouldn't expect any less. It's an uncomfortably large neckband. Almost twice the size of my realme buds wireless. Also after 50% the battery drops down very quickly.
Build quality: feels cheap. The mesh inside the earpiece fell off the first da...",3

Pros:
1.Best in Budget

Cons:
1.Wire is a bit lengthy so they feel so uneasy hanging down you neck to your navel.
2. The greatest disadvantage there is a sound delay while playing PUBG it's like 1 sec sound delay and it matters a lot for players.

YOU WILL GET KILLED EASILY IF ENEMY SHOOTING YOU WHEN YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT HIM. TILL THE TIME YOU HEAR GUNSHOT AND YOU ATTACK YOUR HALF HP IS GONE. SO NOT USEFUL PRACTICALLY.

FOR GAMING IT SEEMS ALWAYS WIRED HEADPHONES ARE BEST, THEY ARE WITH 0 LATENCY.

Last time, it lasted only for a year. Probably because of my rough use. I would appreciate if you could increase the quality of the wire. Thankyou.",4
12298,"sound quality is good but I think either their is some problem with my mobile audio jack or audio jack of headphone.
but my old headphone is working fine with it.
the problem is it's not correctly fitting to the mobile that's why sometimes microphone doesn't work or sometimes the headphone it self doesn't work.

but when it works sound is awesome üëå

Reason is very simple , the voice calling quality of 131 is very poor, the person in phone cant hear your voice clrealy . So this was the main reason to choose 402.

Pros :-
1) high bass

Boat headsets are definitely more bass oriented and don't provide a very balanced output - you can always feel more of the bass without tweaking eq.

12902,Bass is very decent and u can feel the excellent sound quality when you watching a movie .. charging backup is good upto 3.5hrs almost . OnePlus buds z is light weight and its desin is quite good ... Best option for. Under 3-5k... Choose dis OnePlus buds z after u can experience the crystal clear audio along with Dolby Atmos support,5

Second thing their calling quantity is very poor. They only work well if you are sitting in a very quiet room in outdoor and other noisy areas they are futile.

Sound quality is nice but at high volume there is slight disturbance but the bass drivers are up to the mark.

Active noise cancellation is so good and design quality also nice.
Overall it is good to buy it",5

Only you have to do is adjust the equilizer in your phone for better bass and quality sound. It has a good latency and best for gaming like Pubg.

This problem is not a big problem to me . Now it is very comfortable to use.,5

13394,Nice Product Recived Today Very Good Sound Quality And Very Good Bass But It's Not Soo Good For Pubg But Ok Over All Value For Money,5
13395,Best sound quality and much n more comfortable in 1k-3k range. Battery backup is also well - it lasts for at least 12 13 hour. And take lesser time to fully charge.,4
13396,it's a good product on this price... sound quality is good...bass is great to hearing... and thanks to Flipkart for the fastest delivery...,4
13397,"Best wireless earphone under 1k.
Bass is damm awesome.
Design is almost good but wire is a little bit small.
If you buy for listening bass boosted audios then good otherwise you have to use an equalizer if you listen to mood calming music as the clarity of sound would lack because of bass.
You can't play PUBG or any shooting or battle royal games as there is time delay which can get you killed before you get aware of enemies.",5
13398,"I have purchased this product for 999 for this price it's Worthy. I loved the sound, built quality and battery life (5 to 6 hours).

I don't like the ear tips, it not that comfort for long time and when we take calls, it not clear in out door.",4
13399,"What to say about the product,very much satisfied with the sound quality and the bass,bass is also good but not comparable with the wired one.Connnectivity is good but could be improved but the back up time is fabulous.Overall a very good product in this range",4

i bought it for 999 so it is good in this price range love it",5
13401,"Nice deal at 999 Rs. I am not a sound quality expert but its good as compare to Samsung Level U. It has enough Bass, Noise cancellation and Sound clarity. Light weight and Good design. The only con I feel after using for around 4 months, The Mic is not positioned well sometimes I need to hold it near to my mouth while on call in a crowdy place.",4
13402,"Awesome product. The best neckband in this price range. No other neckband is comparable to this. I even tried the Boult curve, and the experience was worst. So I highly recommend Boat Rockerz 255 to all.",5

The Flipkart should improve their service for exchange as I was looking for the same product with different color under exchange facility..

13557,hi I am Rahul awesome wireless headphone excellent sound quality 5 star but baselight but everyday usage super good product,5
13558,"I am using for a week ....nice and its my first bluetooth headset .....adjustment is very nice ....you can't see the adjustment with top brand ....so,,,i really like it ..",4
13559,"Thanks filpkart for getting it delivered on time and the best part is i got it at Rs 812 only during the sale.
The earphones are superb...The sound quality is superb and the build quality is also good.Preferably it would be the best Bluetooth earphones in the market available.",5
13560,"Excellent BOULT

Was confused between Boult Vs boAt. But after using one of my friends Boult Headset, it was crystal clear to buy the same.

Audio is very clear while calling. True Bass listening songs.

Battery Backup is also fine. Very much user friendly",5
13561,"After heavy usage of this headphone for two weeks I m writing this review...

The performance and quality build-up of headphone is Amazing and mind-blowing... The Battery lasts up to 12 to 14 hrs.. The quality of Bass and Sound is just outstanding...


I am giving the rating of features as :

Bass : 10/10
Battery : 10/10
Sound : 10/10
Performance : 10/10
Quality Build-up : 10/10

Do not go for other choice.. This is the perfect choice for perfect Bluetooth headphone in budget range...!",5
13562,nice neckband comfort in ear but bass is not upto mark u can hear good upto 80% volume u can hear clumsy audio Above it over all product is good go for it it has Greta üîã battery backup,5
13563,Good. It's a basic Bluetooth headset. I would prefer those who want decent headset at 899 big billion day offer. Boat 255 is the best one for sound quality but not battery and Boult is best for battery not for sound. Sound effect is very normal in this headset. My Boat 499 rupees headset is better than this headset. Not bad not good average,3
13564,This is My Experience of 10 days.. I have no word to say This BT Curve Boult.... This is Amazing what i want.. I'v Got it Battery Backup is Amazing ...If you want to Listen music You will play nonstop 7-8 hours.. standby 2-3 days. i was purchased on offer period on 1200/- I strongly suggest yiu to buy this.. you will be Happy..God Bless you,5
13565,"Good product. If you are a bass lover then you will be dissatisfied. But it worth the money at such affordable price. Packaging is good. Sound clearit is good. Product received at proper time.
Thank you Flipkart.",4
13566,Excellent Designed Very Beautiful and Bass Sound Very Good I Like This Headphones Good Qwality,5
13567,Really it's amazing product.....I am really happy with mic quality and battery backup....... for those will receive more calls this is the best product to choose....,5
13568,I get it yesterday and i m using it continually after purchase its battery backup is so nice sound is good and nice base. I bought it only 999 in flipkart sale and i wannna say it is good bluetooth headset in 999,4
13569,very nice product . good Battery backup and good sound quality. overall excellent product .Build quality of earphones are good but neckband and especially better could be better,5

it has a great battery backup it gives a backup upto 8-9 hrs
I will give update soon",5
13571,"Average product , sound is to loud , you can't enjoy bass. Battery and build quality is not bad.
Never recommend for music Lovers. In this price segment you get other good products with good sound quality.",1
13572,"Awesome Experience. Worth Price. Suggested to all. Awesome quality. 15-20 persons in my close friends, colleagues and family members are using this earphone. All are rated 5* to this product. Highly Appreciable.",5
13573,"My friend had same model but to my surprise the one i bought didn't have many features like vibration & bass. Voice and build quality is also not as good as the one with my friend.

How can a company sell two products with same model name?

Please check before buying. if its the one with the vibrator, its a good one.",1
13574,A sturdy product at a very reasonable price. No compromise on sound quality. Deep base and powerful magnets to keep earpbuds in place. I can personally pay a little more to have active nose cancellation which will make it a flawless product.,5
13575,"Honest Feedback !!!

please don't buy them if u r a True Bass lover ! Even 600 rupees earphones of JBL give better bass than these. Being a bass lover I'm little bit dissapointed and feeling misguided by many Reviews here. Now i'm using them by keeping custom equilizer but can't work on youtube and other video songs.",3

13579,There is no bass in this earphone so if you prefer to listen music with high bass earphones then you'll regret. Also there is a promotion strategy going on with this product which most of you all don't know whereby you'll get a movie ticket voucher by giving high ratings and positive reviews on flipkart from the Boult company. So all of the postive reviews that you'll find for this product is not trustworthy and the people giving those reviews also got duped and now they want to dupe others a...,1

Pros
1 .. great sound quality ( refined, doesn't feel like an echo or sound being played too close to the ear)
2... passive sound blocker ( 40% of sounds are blocked when nothing is being played on the device)

13584,"Dont purchase this product.. all rating that giving just for free movie ticket which include in the box.

 Worst products, I purchased Boult curve on Flipkart but received broken earphone, later it got replaced. Now coming to the sound quality first thing is there is no such thing like deep bass and woofer. Even after using equilizer there is a very slight difference in bass after boosting 50 to 200hz and 200 to 500hz to 9db and 6 db. Connects to the phone instantly like other devices but you...",2

1. Sound Quality:
The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me. Whether it's about mid frequencies, vocals or the high frequency trebles, or even the lower frequencies, this neckband deals all of those with superior performance. Undoubtedly.

2. Bass:

And at 100% you can even sit in auto and can listen to your favourite music...
Go for it without second thought",5

It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesome then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i got 40% of remaining charger. i changed this neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.,5

This is after 10days review.
I charged for 3time only- battery backup really nice
No irritation at all while placing
There is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving person
Sounds are really amazing

I will re edit again after 20days
Design, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.
No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.

Nice one... Good ...",5
13858,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios.
I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up.
But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???",2
13859,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience,1
13860,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me ü§¨,1
13861,NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well. The connectivity is pretty impressive..The fit is perfect in ears and doesn't give pain after long hours.I was using MI Basic earphones for a year and switched into this and I think it was the best decision ever.Overall it is the perfect earpiece that u can have for enjoying uninterrupted songs and voice calls.,5
13862,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ...",4
13863,"Before purchasing I was so nervous about it. But now i bet no else wireless earphone can compete it.... Realme is nothing in front of it....

The connectivity is very easy. I can easily connect it with multiple devices. I like the music backup it almost lasts for 15 hr. Which is enough for my daily usage. I highly like this.",5
13865,"I recommended to all the buyer to go for this product only there are lots of brand in the market like noise, jbl, Realme boat and all but if your budget is 2000 then go for this item only you gona love it trust me. this is the long term review from my side and thanx me later.",5
13866,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,
Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely",1
13867,"1. Call quality is Good. I have tested the call infront of high volume TV. The call was pretty good and didn't hear much noise if TV music. 4.5/5
2. Music is good. Bass is not as expected. But if you adjust the Equalizer, the Music is good. 4/5.

13873,"Rich clear sound , don't go for boat if you want a long term product , by spending 700 more get these , boat won't last long , if we tak about bass it's more and real in hd and 4k videos and normal in low quality video so bass depends on video quality ,saying by testing for 1hour straight from trailers to bass test to songs to movies... Just go it or if your budget is more just go for one plus earbuds for 3k but battery is still in testing mode charged full in 20-30min from 20%to 100 ..",4

13876,"Simply outstanding
Review after 5days of heavy usage
First thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.
The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.
The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..
Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.",5

Working till now with no issues. Highly Recommended....",5
13878,I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees. Build quality is excellent. Material used is very premium. Sound quality is also top notch. Battery life is also very good. Very happy with this product.,5

Pros:
1. excellent build quality

Cons:
1. Missing quick switch button",4
13881,"This is not a very good product as per brand value and its price bracket. People who have given very good rating perhaps not used any other earphone earlier. I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus. Investing almost 2k is not worth. It will better to go for boat.

13897,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.,4

*Latency is ok not good at all
*High sound makes some noise and we can miss crystal clear sound",4

I dont like the bass performance but the overall make, fit and finish is good. Built Quality is good. The higher variant of the Oneplus Wireless Bullets 2 are way too good than this product in terms of sound and quality.

At this price point of Rs. 1799, this is not the best product. It sounds like a Rs. 1000 product which are also available on flipkart with different branding.",3

The final thing is battery... It's excellent in my words.I got more than 12 hours of battery backup throughout 3 days with more than 6 hours of calling. One more additional thing is that it can be charged within 50 minutes to 100% and 10 minutes of charging gives more than 60% of charge.

Great for watching movies or listening to music. Only problem is in calling. I have to keep left on ear and on right side hanging as it brings mic closer to mouth so that other end can hear the call clearly. If not than other end often complains about not hearing my voice clearly while using this earphone.,5

Problems I'm facing

1. Buds don't charge while you charge ur case.
This means once u charge ur case, u have to again leave ur buds and case for the buds to get charged.

2. No charging indicator for the case.

3. Bass boost and dynamic modes in the realme link app are not good.

That the buds didn't charge from the case when it fully discharged.Yes I have tested it 3 times and the product I recieved is not charging when the buds are discharged below 10 percentage.so when you go down 10 percentage please immediately put it in case. otherwise your buds will not charge even your case is fully charged.

Updated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.
Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.
Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.",3

I must say at this price point the product is quite good.

Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.

Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.

Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is.",4

First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound quality
A decent bass
A nice battery backup
But it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.
My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.
You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.
Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...

Okay. I don't know why I was thinking it would be a bit larger in size. But all and all, a really good product. BOAT never Disappoints.
The sound quality is really clear. Don't expect alot of Bass from it though. But it's really nice that it lacks a bit Bass, and has a really clear sound quality. It just arrived so I'm not sure about the battery backup feature. But, I'm really happy with the product.
the colours would come a bit lighter in shade. I chose Cherry blossom, but it's more lik...",4
14729,It is the best gifted item ever with in the price range I personally use airpod i purchased it to gift someone and I compared it to my AirPods all designs and connectivity is same and good built up only think the blinking light is really irritating and sound clarity is also good range power is also nice I highly recommended it if u r having less budget,5

14732,Really amazing product its really having a long time battery backup nice sound with good quality i would like to request make another one with same features but with sensor quality.. Thank you FLILPKART AND BOAT,4
14733,"All are excellent but it is not connected well with Microsoft Teams call because in other end can't hear properly, so unable to use it for official call. But if you're using only with mobile then it's too good without any doubt. Additionally, it won't block your ear hole fully so you'll get enough ventilation for your ear which eliminate ear problems.",4
14734,See this is like the best u can get in 1299 there is just one problem u see when unbox and connect for first time only one get connected u have to factory reset to that part is hilarious I was shocked first then I made it correct and bass and sound should be improved,4
14735,This pair of headset is perfectly fine and worth every penny. The sound quality is absolutely clear with defined bass. Mic works perfectly fine. Also perfectly suitable for people who wear earphones during driving. Though it is risky but still works absolutely good. Battery is good. Perfect airdopes at reasonable price.,5

2. Timely delivered
3. Built quality is good

The product is nice built quality is good .but don't expect too much bcoz it's a budget friendly product .
Sound is also nice but bass is not enough ..",5
14739,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:
1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.
2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it.
3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look.",5
14740,"Sound quality is above average and bass is low , design and look is amazing. At this price range it is a great deal . If you are a good music lover do not go for this, for call purposes it is good.",4

On the box it is printed by the manufacturer at the price of MRP 5990 so in that sense these earphones out do the 1500 price tag. The most noticeable bit is the bass which is pretty good and high.

15186,"After 2 days of use I must admit that it's worth going for it.
Excellent qualities for daily use with perfect battery backup.
Light weight
Good built quality
Good Bass
Call quality is Crystal clear while using it at home not tested while driving.
Music quality is also good.
For daily use it is OK at this price range .... recommend to go for it.
Pairing issues if faced while using for first time can be easily resolved by seeing the available videos on YouTube!!",5

Some of the users may be having connectivity issue but for that, one thing I'd like to suggest, take out two buds together from the case and wait for getting paired with your device. If one of the buds stops working then put both of the buds in the case and again take it out then try to pair. It will work. This is happening because right bud is the master bud and other one is slave, m...",5

There is a prominent echo so you cannot use them to attend calls. The microphone is not sensitive enough, you gotta bring one earphone near your mouth to make yourself audible (with the echo, of course). Not worth it, spend a little more and get better ones.",1

Matte finished case with good quality

balanced performances its bass , sound quality , even battery backup is much more enhanced than these Airdopes 402",3
15197,"Before buying this Airdopes 402, i bought Airdopes 131...
Now the point is why i replaced this with 402.
Reason is very simple , the voice calling quality of 131 is very poor, the person in phone cant hear your voice clrealy . So this was the main reason to choose 402.
This particular model is also better interms of overall sound quality!
Must buy at this price point ! Fully satisfied with flipkart !",4
15198,It's very lighter and the built quality is strong...easy to carry anywhere and Ctype charging attract me the most...It is little bit waterproof...easy to use while workout and little rain...but I suggest to aal buyers do not use this while riding..because it's sound is very high and it's rubber do no allow to reach outside voice to your ear....finally it is very nice product...üôÇ,5

Apart from music, Build Quality, Charging, connectivity is good.

I think wired Boat headset quality is far better when compared to this.

Overall disappointed with the purchase!",3
15202,If you want to use it for just listening to music and watching videos then it is an awesome Bluetooth.. but if you are looking for using it for calling purposes..then I will suggest don't by this one.. as voice keep echoing.. and also other person is not able to hear you with this Bluetooth.. success rate for calling is like.. 2 out of 10 attempts.. might be ok to use it for very short talks.. but definitely not for longer conversations..,3

New version comes with type C port

Clear sound

Just an OK bass

1) More Bass
2) Music Clarity is somewhat 'ok' as it gets hampered by the Bass

Pros :

1) Cheap and Wire Quality is really good.
2) With a Mic facility unlike senhesizer.
3) With a Good Bass Quality",4

Sound quality is good but for low to medium volume music.
It's design is fantastic...

But, I advise the buyer to first try and confirm your size S or M or L before continue using for long time. So, it may prevent pain.

It's an good one, referring to its price and comparing it to other quality products.

Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges

Believe me never think to purchase it

It's very less efficient for avg class people
Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees

Print quality is not good as laser printer

After refilling not expect to see good results

It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less

So my suggestion to all those people who want...",1
15745,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.

What I got with this very neat looking printer -

1. connecting cables
2. color + black ink cartridges
3. Driver cd

Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.

Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.

Cheers to Flipkart :)",5

The printing is very slow.
The copy and scan function works fine (good speed).

But cartridge is expansive
But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge
Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge

Once again product is amazing
Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§",5

CONS:

2. Print speed is too slow.
3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.

Suggestion:
Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink!

After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.

One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION.

I am much satisfied with its performance.",5

Black ink for sure works quite well. Have taken around 50 pages and still the level of ink hasn't deteriorated.

Suggestions for buyers and users-
1. If you think that printing cost is high then try refilling the cartridge. It cost 150 rupees per bottle of ink and has 100 ml. Cartridge can be refilled upto 20-25 times from ink bottle. After refilling the printing cost of color mode comes down to 0.99 to 1.20 rupees and black 0.30 rupees estimated by me.

Printer came with 2 black cartridges and 1 color cartridge. The 1 extra black cartridge was because of some offer by the OEM itself, which wasn't mentioned at the time of purchase, but nevertheless was appreciated since it was included within the box.

Setting Up:
Was easy to set up and get started printing, though I feel Canon's software is too bloated (almost 2 GB). Also connected this printer to multiple other laptops within the household. First time it needed to be connected ...",4
15963,"I bought this about 6 months and using it for home usage. It is pretty nice product which solves the domestic needs like school projects, photo copy, ticket print outs and other medium requirements. Worth buy it. Wi-Fi printing is pretty tricky. Your Wi-Fi router should have a WPS button to syncup with the printer. Airtel supplied modems won't work.",5
15964,"Good printer around 5k...
WiFi setup is very time consuming for new user...
1st print takes quite more time over WiFi...
Little expensive for frequent user...
Scanning quality is good...
WiFi printing need router...but those who don't have any router in their home can use hotspot for another phone available...
Overall good printer...",4
15965,"Printer is not good for daily uses.
1. Most of time doesn't take paper automatically from tray. You have to pick a paper and push adjust it so that printer can take it for print.
2. Paper jam is very common. You'll waste at least 2-3 papers per day.
3. Consume a lot of ink, specially colour.
4. Both black and colour cartridges are expensive. 1 Black cart. prints approx 300 pages (more than ‚Çπ1.5 per paper) . I didn't count for colour cart. but it's not much.

It's definitely not for daily use...",2
15966,good for home ND small office work. Wi-Fi not connecting with mobile,3
15967,"It's a perfect one for the small business use!!!
Professional!!! Compact!!!
You may ask,then why you rated 3star..
It's because of the delivery issue!
I got the delivery without any connection cable's and ink cartridges!
But then, they changed it immediately and responded back with the new one on Air freight wihin a week of time!",3
15968,The colour cartridge I received is off only 40% filled. After taking 5 colour printout the colour bottom is glowing with an indication that the colour cartridge is low . Connecting with the wifi is too horrible. Rest of the things is okay with that price range . If your planning to take more colour printouts then really don't go with this product. Taking Black and white colour printout is cost effective.,3

Don't ever ever buy this printer.. only in 6 months of usage we need to change the drum which is available nowhere and it's price is also very high.. ink is so difficult to put in, half the times ink falls out..

When we put in new ink, still error will keep showing low on ink.. and new ink for around Rs.900, we don't get 900 pages in total..

My money is wasted, please don't buy this printer..

16851,‚úçÔ∏èIt's very easy to use with wounderful printings. There are no deference between hp 419 and hp 319 without wifi connection. So if you want to buy a wonderful printer then it's here but always remember it's not a fast printer. Thank you üôè,5
16852,Nice printer it‚Äôs work very good we are happy for receiving product and hp engineer visit my home to installation of printer thank u Flipkart,5
16853,I am happy and satisfied with the product and people are talking about the printer is slow but i did not find any issue. Printer is fast not slow. And print quality is good. Easy to use.,5
16854,Printer is good but it can't print both side automatically you have set paper manual and photo printing is awesome and printing speed is enough for home and personal and office use. Printing cost is very less affordable . Hp service is superb .,4
16855,"Pros:
1. Fast delivery.
2. Product packaging is really good.
3. Installation is very simple and step by step process is given.
4. Unlike what I have seen in other reviews, it did come with 3 HP GT52 color bottles and 2 HP GT51XL black bottles.
5. Print quality is good and color reproduction is satisfactory.

Cons:
1. Color printing is super slow and if you have regular color printing requirements of multiple pages, DON'T buy this one or any inkjet printer.",5

18004,Its and awesome printer and very easy to operate. Some comments i read below are about the cost of original hp ink. To cut down the cost of bulk printing you can use GoColour ink to refill the cartridge and it yeilds good quality print not as much good as original ink.

Once your product will start performing not well, even in the Replacement/warranty period, then they will not provide a solution and try to trap you through rules and regulations.

18461,"excellent product.. easy installation, i can print wirelessly both from PC and mobile but for better print quality only print from PC .. i am giving four star because delivery service was not that good . they took so many days to deliver",4

Strong point of Canon is compact n printing of odd pages and even pages are possible in one click.
Hp lags in this...if we want to take 100 pages both side then manually one by one page we have to turn n feed..

Now, about the product.

Buying Decision:
I had seen quite a few online review and installation videos of this product and many other products. I was choosing between Cannon, HP and Epson.

Cannon I dropped after reading few reviews about poor image quality and slow print performance,

Overall, Very good printer in this price range for home or office use with moderate printing jobs!",4
18471,"Not worth the money you spend... I was using a HP printer which i purchased TEN YEARS AGO... THAT, was giving better print quality than the new one which I bought... Yes, I have done proper research, have optimised all the settings, have set the quality of print to the best possible setting, aligned and cleaned the printer through the software provided by HP. But still, the quality of prints remains bad... Really disappointed after spending 11k on this... There were regular inkjet printers on...",2

I owned a J4580 desk jet but the b&w and color toners used to cost me closed to 3k and it doesn't last long. However, this one seems far better. But disappointing factor is you can't change any settings physically on the printer such as # copies, increase or reduce size, etc and you need the software or app. If you are not on the same wifi then you won't be able to connect and ...",3

It's speed is around 6 pages per minute for black and white ,so it can be it only cons , but it's fine for home usage .
Don't go for cheap cartridges based printers , as it ink easily dries out ,if not used frequently.

This printer has many advantages

But only the thing is it support hp 803 ink cartige which is costly more than 700 Rs but it can refilled using the riffiling kit for hp 803 ink cartige which cost nearilly 300 Rs for two time reffiling",5
18631,This product is really very awesome .the price is perfect ..and it is ideal for homeuse but the price of the cartridge is very high ...i am not giving 5 stars for this product only for the high price of the cartrige otherwise i am satisfy with this product ..and thank u flipkart for giving me this printer in low price..,4

18634,"For a home based use its a best product.
Very compatible for daily printing.
Nd don't buy hp original cartridge bcoz its very costly, use turbo refill kit to rrfill your original cartridge which is free with your printer purchase.
Overall it's a best.

Superb",5
18635,Printer is very good for home use. It is light and is easy to set up and operate. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE COST OF COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE HP 803 which is very expensive. A combo of black and multicolor HP 803 cartridges will cost you around ‚Çπ1500/- (for 2 cartridges) which is more than half of the cost of this printer. Hence i didn't give 5 star rating.,3
18636,"First of all, hats off to flipkart for delivering the printer 5 days before the expected date. So, no complaints about that.

18644,I bought it for kids and they are happy. I think it is a very best option if you use it for school projects and academicworks. I am yet to go for the purchase of cartridges then I think it'll b a little bit overweight on my wallet but it's ok for now. I wanted to help my kids with their project and do some records copying works with that and it is satisfying me.jus 2 days of experience. thank you Flipkart.,4
18645,printer is good and have excellant printing but the problem is ink cartridge is too much costly.there are two cartridges one is black and another color.But one cartridge costs Rs900 and it will print only 190 pages.There is another solution but I haven't tried it yet to refill the ink cartridges and refill ink costs Rs 350 for 100ml and 2 ml refill ink prints 50-60 pages. and also onething in demo cartridges i.e cartridges which will come with printer.And also it is suitable for less number...,5
18646,Excellent for home use for occasional printing only but very useful for regular scanning use compared to its affordable cost. Printing/cartridge cost is too high so not suitable for regular or heavy printing.,4
18647,my first printer.... in this range the printer is really very gd.... only one problem there.... the ink is so costly. but there is one sollution for this situation. you may use turbo refil kit for your hp cartridge. you must enjoy the authentic and superb printing quality in your printer. don't worry. just go for it.,5
18648,"It's good .. it is very helpful to me ,I make many projects with its help over all I love it",4
18649,"The printer is very useful for personal use, not reliable for commercial use. I got only 50 pages per refill/cartridge. Best quality with original HP cartridge and ink. Can use ink like turbo HP 803 but lower in quality. I tried but printer is not showing ink level.",4
18650,"Good printer for the price. Scanning quality is not that good. Printing quality is totally acceptable. Printing is a bit slow. Pretty noisy but I guess that's the same with every other inkjet printer out there.
Overall verdict - Good All in one printer at reasonable price.",4
18651,In one word it is an excellent printer.If you are on tight budget and want to use it as home purpose it will serve you well..The Inks are also low cost you can refill and use if you are a daily heavy user..But the thing which I don't like about is the build quality..The material used are very cheap plastic..That's how HP cut the manufacturing cost.so place it in a well firm place as it is quite delicate..Moreover the scanning and copying is also very smooth though it takes quite a few seconds...,5
18652,"Pros

1. The colors and clarity is just amazing.
2. The scanning is impressive and quick. Photocopy is also great.
3. Installation is very easy and quick.
4. Photo prints look professional.
5. It is very light weight, occupies average space and looks good.

Cons

1. Cartridge prices are a little high but you can always go for refill.
2. The color printing speed is a slow as compared to laser printers but that is obvious.
3. Cartridge can dry up so don't leave it unused for very long.

Its...",5
18653,"Best part is looks and better part is good printing quality and fast printing. However, the ink consumption is not satisfactory. Huge expense and less output. Go for this if you want to save time. But money? Get ready to spend 500 after 200 pages.",4
18654,The ink of cartridge drain very very fast and cost rupees 1600 to buy both new cartridges. Rest the printing quality is good enough fir daily use. Print time per page is also fine aroung 4_5 sec per page for black. Overall it is a nice product but instead buying cartridges buy ink.,3
18655,"This is an excellent product for students who are in class 6 to 12 or for students who preparing iitjee,aipmt etc.But its cartridge is very low so i recommend the to buy ""turbo refill kit"" which is available in flipkart cost 250 instead of buying hp ink cartridge cost 700",5
18656,Nice product. Brought in 2300. Value for money and good for home purpose but not good if you want to use high printing. Since consume more ink. Cartridge can be refilled but Extra care for leaking of ink should be taken care. Liquid toner require to refill. Overall value for money.,4
18657,Don't buy this product because after using of 3 months this printer is not worked properly and refilling process is big issue of this printer,1

18677,"Well its very good, printing clarity is excellent that you would not find on printing shops, power consumption is less works on inverter easily, no shock fear, portable less weight.
Bad thing is that you cant leave it without use for more than 3 days because after that catridge would get stop working and for revive that you have to whiff in the whole of catridge with high pressure.Ink can be easily filled as well.
Overall its good for daily purposes at home and for small shops",5

People worry bout cartridges too much.Of course it's costly.But don't worry.To solve this problem don't go for cartridges but go for bottled refill ink which will save you lots of money.Its much cheaper and you can print more dn 1000 pages.But you will have to know thr basic knowledge of refilling yourself and you will have to compromise the quality of the print a little.

In India Epson has 46%+ market share in ink tank printer category.

19038,"This has been more than a year with us. If the usage is on a regular basis then go for it. If you use it once a week or so then the cartridge ink dries up and each time you'll have to buy with an expense of Rs. 1800/-
Therefore, it is too costly. I would rather suggest to go in for HP printer (the cartridges are relatively cheaper) or a laser printer will be the best option.",2

But the finishing of the product is terrible. The front & top faces are fine but the back & inner portions are terribly casted. Also the scanner tray is not so rigid.
So I would suggest to spend few more bucks & go for HP M1005.

Flipkart delivered one day late as promised, But thats okay cause i was not in a hurry to get it !!!",5

Very Poor Software offered by HP. Every document scans Twice for the reason unknown to me. Canon E500 that I used earlier had a lot better scanner than this one.

As far as the Printer is concerned, hats off. It works great! Speed is awesome. Copying speed is great.

Sans the scanner, everything is perfect.",5
19113,"A good all-in-one printer at an affordable price.

However, a drawback is that it doesn't have an Ethernet port if one might want to make it networked, though there's the symbol of network connectivity engraved on its back.

It's nice, the best thing about this is that you can easily make a xerox copy without the intervention of a PC.
Very fast in printing.
But The HP UI is not user friendly.
Canon gives mp navigator which helps us to do alot of things easily but here even though the scanner n printer are better but the UI lacks proper design.
Many third party drivers are available to overcome this problem but are paid version.
A normal user cannot use this printer at it...",4

Pros:
1. Best Laser Printer and gives very good print out.
2. Gives good number of print out.
3. Scanner is awsome and can be configured to get good pixel density scan.

Cons:
1. Black and White Printer.
2. No Wifi support.

I will not count this as Cons as it was mentioned in the specification but its pros are that good that you can ignore its cons.

Good print & photocopy quality & speed
very easy to use (my wife who can use it too ie its really easy), one button photocopy
Bad
Had initial challenge setting it up but once done it worked like charm.
Ugly
plastic quality is bad, the section where cartridge opens is resting on a joint which seems like handmade, fixing some plastic pieces and a spring which I reckon would snap easily.

Pros:
1For home and small business owners, it's a apt printer with all required feature.
2. Best print quality.
3. Compact and worth for money.
4. Seperate print heads are the catch point from rest of printers.
5. Ink bottles be provided self discharge with different nozzles like in Epson printers.
6. Installation specifically connecting to WiFi is little cumbersome. Should made more easier like Hp.

19196,its very good printer and it have more futures. Photo print is excellent. It print also pvc card. I want original ink of canon any know share original canon ink to buy its help for me,5
19197,It's really awesome print in matte with 270 gsm and only thing is very slow in Xerox it's take 1.32 minutes to take one print of b/w Xerox . If it be fast as mentioned 8.8 prints per minute but reality it was only 1.32 min to take one print . If it's for business it will be waste but for home purpose it's good even for photo studio it will be more use and it's ink was great as less consumption for color print or b/w after 10 days of usage .,5

19584,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:
Like every IP...",5
19585,"Monitor is great on its own but it wasn't a worthy upgrade for me or my expectations were more from it being an IPS display. I had a samsung monitor previously with VA panel and it was working perfectly. Never faced any issues. The colors were great but the vertical viewing angles were bad which again didn't matter so much. But I got tempted into buying an IPS display monitor after seeing it's features and reviews so I unnecessarily spent money on this.

Now comparing it to my 8 year old sams...",4
19586,"A definite upgrade over the popular 22mp68vq. For a price of 11k, choosing this over that is a no-brainer! 75hz refresh rate supported natively as well over HDMI. 24 inch is perfect size for a 1080p display, so I am glad this isn't smaller or bigger. PERFECT!",5
19587,"Nice monitor features are fully loaded.
Pros
viewing angles is very good
Color calibrated monitor colors output is very natural.
Amd freesync monitor but it's work also on intel processor
75 HZ refresh rate
Cons
No power LED indicator",4
19588,Best monitor brand in this price range. 75hrtz and amd free sync are good option. Working absolutely fine. But in order to use amd free sync one need to install radeon graphics app and customize the setting for each game Or universal as you want.,5

19590,"Bought it for WFH. It's an amazing purchase. The colours are good, bezels are thin (only 3 sides). And the joystick is fun to operate. There is a reader mode in the monitor which blocks blue light. Also it's probably not mentioned here, but vertical angle adjustment is possible.
Only thing which took me by surprise is.. The back portion is white coloured which is not obvious from the images shown here. I was fine so kept it.",5

19674,"1 Own 3 of these and I must say.....Benq is best at display...Really gives you paperlike feeling at reading mode. Reading text was never so better..On the other hand, the IPS panel of this gives you incredible display with decent black levels that we are used to.
If you buy these you will feel style dropping off from these.Its beautiful ;)...Loving it.

19688,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5

The monitor briefly flickered two times, but I guess that could be due to cable being little loose in the laptop's end. I am not touching it anymore and it works fine. 24"" display is perfect, not too big or small. I use it for coding or when I need to open a large spredsheet, sometimes watch movies as well.

For my purpose of coding and other general works It come to be a good choice. One week usage is not a period of finding cons and issues.

20653,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:
Like every IP...",5
20654,"Monitor is great on its own but it wasn't a worthy upgrade for me or my expectations were more from it being an IPS display. I had a samsung monitor previously with VA panel and it was working perfectly. Never faced any issues. The colors were great but the vertical viewing angles were bad which again didn't matter so much. But I got tempted into buying an IPS display monitor after seeing it's features and reviews so I unnecessarily spent money on this.

Now comparing it to my 8 year old sams...",4
20655,"A definite upgrade over the popular 22mp68vq. For a price of 11k, choosing this over that is a no-brainer! 75hz refresh rate supported natively as well over HDMI. 24 inch is perfect size for a 1080p display, so I am glad this isn't smaller or bigger. PERFECT!",5
20656,"Nice monitor features are fully loaded.
Pros
viewing angles is very good
Color calibrated monitor colors output is very natural.
Amd freesync monitor but it's work also on intel processor

Cons
No power LED indicator",4
20657,Best monitor brand in this price range. 75hrtz and amd free sync are good option. Working absolutely fine. But in order to use amd free sync one need to install radeon graphics app and customize the setting for each game Or universal as you want.,5

20659,"Bought it for WFH. It's an amazing purchase. The colours are good, bezels are thin (only 3 sides). And the joystick is fun to operate. There is a reader mode in the monitor which blocks blue light. Also it's probably not mentioned here, but vertical angle adjustment is possible.
Only thing which took me by surprise is.. The back portion is white coloured which is not obvious from the images shown here. I was fine so kept it.",5

20759,"The monitor is pretty cost effective, but the color quality is very poor. If you do no have a strict budget please go for a different model or a different brand. My 5 year old AOC has and 6 year old LG has much better color quality than this. I do not have any use of this monitor. It gives you faded image.",2

20824,"BenQ 22inch panel monitor looks and work great, easy to assemble. Packaged in very protective manner, deliver was good. Much satisfied with this purchase.
Down side: Volume is considerable low. Power input cord is large 3 pin which generally seen with A/C, refrigerators and washing machines. Its uncommon in household we have many of such sockets at right spot.",4
20825,The monitor is aesthetically very pleasing with minimum bezzel around the sides except the bottom. The display quality is very good and the colours are fairly accurate. The monitor can be tilted as per liking and has a sturdy base. The monitor is best suited for office and home use with general computing works. It has speakers but they are very tiny and not useful but it has audio output for attaching external speakers.,5
20826,"Superb quality and works fine as expected. Inbuilt sound is bit poor as it was designed to the one who sit just infront of the monitor.

Overall as remaining reviewers said it is a great product.",5
20827,"It's been a month, i m using the monitor, its working very well, the IPS panel is really nice, viewing angles, colour, sharpness everything is good. Reading, browsing, watching YouTube videos can be done smoothly. Speaker volume is too low but i don't really need them.
What i didn't like about the monitor is that it takes almost 5 seconds to turn on.
Other than that its amazing so i'm rating 5 starts wanted to rate 4.75 but there's no option, so 5 it is.",5

For me it's noting more than a junk. Total waste.
If you have extra money and need a junk that seems pretty go and buy products from flipkart.

I am keeping this in my store room as a souvenir from Flipkart.

I use it with my laptop so that's not a problem for me but you cannot use this to stream media (with fire tv or Chromecast) without a Bluetooth speaker. For the price it's a good deal.,5

Two external antennas cover most of my 2 BHK flat (Except one blind spot).
AC750 - both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands operate very well, though 5GHz range is much less than 2.4GHz.
All the LED indicators are on the top (for keeping at table height), so if you are going to place it at a height on the wall, you won't be able to see the LED indicators (my case). In that case, one can go for Archer C20i AC750, which is same category vertical model with internal antennas....",5

But don't get fooled by reading 5 star reviews which say it will give you optimum speed to your devices. i.e. In 40 MBPS plan, download speed will be 5 MBPS. It doesn't work in my case.

And the TP link router interface is just a bit complex taking the no of features which are available in the router.
Go for it if you want good download speeds.
Edit:TP link Archer Router is a bit better when compared with this router.",3
21902,one of the most trusted and easy and fastest Router at this price range. everyone just go for it without worrying.,5
21903,is really great product and customer support is also very very good My first reaction was how can a router with 5 db gain be available for the cheapest price. There has to be some catch. Almost ordered a different router with 2 antennas each of 2 db gain because of price. Finally settled on this to give it a try. And was wowed. There is nothing missing. Have complete coverage for over two floors(over 3200 sq. ft) across 6 rooms.,5

Bought this for my parents at home. They didn't want to be using WiFi at first as they were not tech savvy and were mostly using internet via normal mobile prepaid connections.

The WiFi Antenna is too bulky, like those old Indicom Walky/Reliance style phones. Apart from that, the product works great. The range is also decent compared to other products I've used(I was able to use my mobile connected to WiFi downstairs, while the router was on the first floor), but signal strength then, is bare min...",4

I read a lot of reviews about this one and TP-Link TD-W8968 (all-in-one) router.

The router supports DWRT firmware but since I have not used it, I cannot comment about that. As far as security is concerned, it supports WPA 2, SPI firewall and NAT. Also to get the most protection, I would recommend you to change the default username and password. So far in the 2 months of usage, I ha...",5

File transfers in the home network maxes out around 400Mbps( in the 5gig band) so far in my tests. USB file sharing also works seamlessly as long as you are using a Windows laptop/PC. Since it comes with an option to wall mount it saves some space for you too.,5

No drops in connection witnessed as of now. The 5g band gives the best speed but its coverage area is less than the 2.4g band. I have a 40mbps plan and using the 5g band, the speed test shows the exact speed.

22319,"Honest review
1. Flipkart service great as always. Packing was okay (instead of wrapping in bubble wrap it was wrapped in small piece of carton due to which box got little damaged) but delivery time was excellent. Delivered in 2 days.
2. Router build quality is okay. As many customers already told about gloss finish easily gets scratched So, I won't get into that details and for me a router looks is not important, its functions are.

22320,"Hi Everyone,

So let's talk about D-Link 819 router. below all comments i personally experience that's way i am sharing with you all Flipkart buyer's and lovers üòÄ

1. D-Link 819 it's a dual band router 2.4 and 5 but the thing is for longer distances 5 gigahertz range not connected. 2.4 gigahertz range covered maximum 1.5bhk room not more than that.

2. As i buy this product for better performance and better experience of wifi range but D-Link 819 router not that much satisfied personally t...",1
22321,"I don't know what people are liking about this product but to my experience what i can say is this product is just a piece of trash. Unusable. I have a 100 Mbps internet connection. And before this router i was using a TP Link singal band router. The signal of that router was so strong i could use that from the street ( I'm not kidding here). But due to some short-circuit the router got fried and i looked for a dual band router. And I got this.
My experience with this router is horrible. I g...",1
22322,"OK. I had searched for so many answers but didn't get it all answered even after going through all the reviews. Anyways bought this Dir819 unit in Aug 2019. I'll try to answer all questions I was looking for, maybe it'll hep others. Also I went for this model specifically since it had both 2.4Ghz (more penetration thru walls) and 5Ghz (higher speed) antennas
1) I primarily wanted this as a repeater to my main Keralavision broadband internet which was connected to a huawei wifi router (built i...",4
22323,"It is a very good router. The range is good for 2.4 GHz. The 5 GHz have a low range but it is normal with 5 GHz. The only problem I found out is that if we are using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz at same time on different devices, the one with 5 GHz isn't fast enough i.e. the bandwidth distribution between both the bands doesn't seem equal. Otherwise it is a great product for its price.",3
22324,"Since last 10 years I was using the net gear n150 which is my first router. As my fire stick was not giving good performance with net gear. I planned to go for this one as this is a dual band supports 5 GHz.

After connecting this beauty, I realised net gear has done its job & this is a beast of a router which is giving me a unparalleled & no loss connectivity at both 2.4 & 5 GHz range.

Just go for it. I love this product.",5
22325,Best wifi router in this price segment. Solid build quality. Great connectivity. No connection drops. 5Ghz speeds are great but range is low as expected with 5Ghz band. 2.4Ghz range is good. Prefect for a medium home.,5
22326,"Best Router at This Price, Satisfy With Both The Network;
Pros: 2.4 and 5 Ghz Both Working Extremely Well...
Go For This For Dual Band, Worth Product.
Cons: Firmware is very weird, no global update and fixes... Even couldn't support bandwith limit.",4

22329,"This Product seems not listed under the D-link India site . So can't see any firmware updates related files etc . More over , the Web ( internet ) LED always blinks ""GREEN"" whether internet is there or not .

22330,Aswm Router In this range..this Router in 2 options.. 5g Router.... Available in(2g/3g/4g) and best version is 5g.. Continue use cooling system. Good Router I am satisfied.. üòäüòä,4
22331,"speed is good but range is not good as i expected
over all it is good for that price",3
22332,"Good product, easy installation, 5ghz range low, because its use for only High speed,2ghz speed good and range also be good. It has Repeater mode,that very nice... There are many more settings on the web GUI, .",5
22333,The product is nice very lite feels cheap plastic and very fragile.the signal strength is very good and the speed its giving is also good but the setting not that easy you have do a lot of setting to properly setup like dns and security protocols of tkip and ies something took me time most of the router came with setting already but not this i got it for 995 so it is a steal a deal for me,3
22334,Very good router. 2.4ghz range is better than tplink c60.5ghz working fine for my firestick.Overall very option at this price. I bought in 999,5

22337,Very much satisfied with this project. The two types of bandwidth 2.4 & 5.0 GHz are additional advantage. But only 2.4 GHz is mostly used. Setting is very easy. Plug and play software is easy to operate and setting. Range is good enough across the 2 BHK home. Speed loss and packet loss is zero.,5
22338,For those who are using cable broadband this router is very good. The 5ghz band although has short range but blazing speed. If you are using 100mbps plan and still getting 5-6 mbps then its time to switch to this router to get full potential of your internet. I am having 80mbps plan with my age old router i was getting 6mbps max now i am getting 9.2mbps at all times. Pretty good router.,5

However it works pretty well even in noisy environments. ( We have 20-30 router signals in 2.4Ghz range near our house still works fine.)",4
22346,working perfectly good product and on time delivery by Flipkart..it works on both 2.5gh and 5gh covers good range,4

Not only that, the mi 4c comes with a great app to control everything and a great interface too, but D-Link doesn't have any app and the interface is very generic. 5ghz band is great, really impressed with the extra speed I get out of the same network.

This dual band router is available for offers from Rs 1200 onwards which enticed me into buying the same. The router was pretty easy to setup and installation did not prove to be a hassle.

But the range of the 5GHz and 2.4 GHz antennas leave a lot to be desired. In a two story house, you can pretty much ignore the 5GHz as the range is very limited, maybe to the room in which the router is kept. Even though the 2.4GHz range is available ...",3

Technically, 2750U is for Telephone line broadbands like bsnl,mtnl,airtel etc(bcoz it has RJ11 port for WAN link) and DIR-615 is for Cable line broadbands(as it has RJ45 port for WAN link).

22602,Good job flipkart nice delivery....,5
22603,Nice product,5
22604,"First of all, It's working good.
3STAR is because 5ghz range is very low. Please note that it says 1200mbps output in the model AC5 but the input speed is only upto 100mbps. This, it won't give speed more than 100mbps.
If you have plan with 150mbps or higher, go for AC8 model.
It is easy to connect and manage with TENDA App.

Pros.
1. Good range. Can cover while house efficiently.
2. Easy set up using TP Link Tether app.
3. Looks great. Elegant finish.
4. Multiple modes - can be setup as a repeater as well.

Cons.
1. Good for upto 3 walls penetration. Signal starts getting weaker after 3 walls.
2. No ONU, only has RJ 45 slot. So if you're using a fibre optic cable network you'll need a seperate ONU adapter to connect it to this router.",5

Flipkart as usual delivered the product on time and well packed. Now about the product-
Pros-
Great network coverage in all rooms. The range is strong and does not fade it is always stable.
Speed is great. Does not reduce the speed even by connecting many wlan devices.
Lightweight and does not heat even when kept on for long time.
Cons-
For now I don't think there is anything missing in the router but it should have had an USB port for direct connection of android d...",3

22714,"I've used this for a month now and I must say so far it has worked amazingly well. Perfect for approximately an area of 1000 sq feet. Totally worth for the price you pay. It looks decent and classy. Once in a month it might just not connect well but just switch it off for an hour maybe and it'll work just fine as before. I think it's totally worth buying .Even though my internet provider set it up for me but it didn't take him much time so I'm assuming it's quite easy to set up.

For a typical 100 Mbps Network
Base Router Speed :
2.4 GHz - 40 Mbps
5 GHz - 100 Mbps

Connect this Extender to only 2.4 GHz of your base rout...",4

Got it for a good price in big shopping days..This is a boon as a WiFi extender..The 5Ghz band works like a charm..to all those who have written that it reduces speed-let me clear that there is nothing as such..it doesn't reduce the speed by even 1%..i was really very worried before buying it after reading reviews that it reduces speed but that's not the case..I am in love with it..Thanks Tp-link & Flipkart for the product and quick delivery..‚ù§Ô∏è,5
22768,The Wifi-Fi range extender is working fine so far. To be fair I have not carried out any speed-tests or anything like that. I wish it was better priced though.,5
22769,A very good range extender that has a good range. I have 2k sq feet house and am using it to have range in 2 bedrooms. The main wifi signal is weak but when it reaches this extender it magnifies it a lot. Great connectivity and good signal strength through the walls as well. A great product for household needs. Go for it.,5

Plz don't but this .. it works as a normal extender . It lags the speed in between",3

But lacks many firewall and control features.
Even after setting for highest transmit power/range, its transmit range is about 25% less than my existing Netgear WN3000RPv3 range extender and old D-Link range extender.
Note: Claims it supports WiFi mesh capability (proprietary OneMesh) with certain TP link routers for seamless WiFi handoffs within home. Since I dont have another Tp link router at present, could not test it.",4
22774,wow this product is too good and this product quality is amazing I love this thank you Flipkart but delivery time is too long,4

The setup is quite simple too.",5
22780,Very Good Dual channel wifi extender at reasonable price.There are more features too like auto on/off timer.You can also monitor number of devices connected through the app.,5
22781,Simple to setup. No dead WiFi zones with this. Can plug in any room where WiFi signal is weak. Need setup only for the first time. Irrespective of your router this generates 2.4GHz and 5GHz signal. 5 GHz can be used by smart TV. This can be used to connect to wired Gaming devices too. A very innovative and quality product. Fits in any room to your switchboard.,5

I could not get any help to rectify this. The solutions available online has also not yielded any result, as most of the buyers have similar issues.

Now this device is with me but I cannot do anything with this.
So be careful in buying and check the compatibility before you buy.",2

I brought this to extend WiFi range in my home, as the signal was weak in other bedroom. I brought this, connected and tested using my mobile by connecting it to 5Ghz band. It showed more speed than actual broadband speed. I thought well, and kept it.

Pros :

I upgraded my bandwidth and I had to purchase a new router! the cable guy had suggested TP link would be ideal for this supplied line, but I chose to do otherwise! again I took the risk of preferring Tenda and put it to the test! and once again, it didn't disappoint! at this price point, it is unbeatable! a well deserving purchase!",5

Can watch 4k content without buffering, comes with many other functions, like guest network, switching off leds and many more.
Totally worth buying.",5

Its perfect to use for multiple devices. I use it for my 2chidrens online class. Its supporting 1 laptop, 1desktop, 3 mobile, 2tab at a time without speed drop. My house has 4 rooms and I got range in all four rooms.",4
23756,Super fast router. You just need to connect it with a stable broadband service according to the availability in your area. Mine is Alliance broadband FTTH and I'm using just the starter package with 60Mbps. But Look what I'm getting wired/wireless both! ü§ëü§ì,5
23757,"Awesome product . Easy setup even for new users .

One important Note that this router is Version 3 , It has 4 x 6dbi antennas and power adapter DC output is 9V 1A .

On 2.4 Range is Awesome nearly double from N150 Router ( Previous Router i used was Tenda W316R) . 5 Ghz range is less .

No connection drop . Currently my ISP is Alliance Broadband , 50Mbps Up and Down .

Go for it .",5
23758,"So far, so good. Getting fast speed at 5GHz band and also good speed in 2.4 GHz band. At max 30 devices can be connected. Router range is also good. I have placed the router in another room and with the door closed, it is still showing full signals in my device. My internet service provider suggested me to buy this product as this has good coverage and provides fast speed.
Worth the price.",5
23759,"The router is easy to setup, have basic parental control and good coverage on 2.4ghz band. Overall I am happy with the product however at this price range they should have added
a. USB support for FTP devices
b. Advance parental controls (only schedule and website (allow or deny) can be applied for all devices. You can't set the control for each device, it will be applied to all devices selected for parental controls. Moreover the web site either could be allowed or disallowed)",4
23760,Perfectly balanced router with Mu-Mimo and beamforming. Got it for 1800 only. Far better range than ac20 of tplink. Archer c6 and ac 10 are the best mid range routers in the market right now. 2 to 3 bhk flats will be covered easily. Looks wise ac 10 is a winner. Full gigabit ports goes well with fiber optic.,5
23761,"Overall good quality router in this price range. There are so many features available in configuration, like parental control time schedule for wifi.
About the quality of signal 2.4 is normal like other routes. 5GHz is better than other routers. We get a decent range. Its can penetrate two walls in my personal experience.
Speed and network stability is good.
And one positive thing I felt is we have android apk to control the router. So we can do some of the things using app itself instead ...",5
23762,Loved this Product from Tenda. Absolutely Electrifying. Money's Worth. Anybody can undoubtedly go for this. Thanks Flipkart for the superfast delivery.,5

23770,Not satisfied. Speed is going up and down continuously. Some time disconnects automatically. Price is also very high than other routes. I raised a complaint regarding the problems facing with this product. A technician visit was scheduled by Flipkart. But the technician did not come and phoned me and asked me for some photos of the router on WhatsApp and closed my issue without any house visit. Now I called Flipkart again and informed him about the same. Customer service is very bad and is no...,2

23776,"Beware that some units do not have the broad blade antennas as shown in the photo, they are giving ordinary antennas, also the power input is mentioned incorrectly as 12v 2 amp it is actually 9v 1amp. Had to return the product because of these discrepancies. Range is very poor and does not cover my 1450 sq ft 3bhk not even in 2.4 GHz band. Probably the people who have received wide antenna model have better range.",1
23777,Awesome range in this process,5
23778,"Not Recommended, range is very short. Only cover 200sqft area. Not worth.",1

23781,Very good,5
23782,"I've Just tested my New Tenda Router.., It's perfoming really well,the only thing i found difficulty is the 5g band wifi is not so reachable..,u should sit in front of Router to get a good strength,if u even go 2steps away then the 5g wifi will be decreased to 2points or 1point signal strength.., behalf of that all are excellent !
Hope they may upgrade the 5g band wifi strength someway more !",5

Only Con is that you can't give devices connected to the router a static IP address.

I have read so many different reviews regarding this product TP Link RE205 AC750.but after research I choose to go with this and I can tell you it's the best product in this price range.
I am writing this review after 10 days of use.

23971,"For 2.4GHz :
If you can place the extender within 10 meter of your main router it works fine with 2.4GHz .. but above 10 meter it doesn't work speed goes down drastically..

For 5GHz :
You have to place it within 5-7 meter, after that it is unable to receive signals of 5GHz.

My phone catch better signals then my router.

My opinion :
Don't buy this Extender because it can't fullfil your needs.

Don't buy any Dual band 750mbps Extender or Router , because the difference between the speed at...",1
23972,this is an excellent product. have used this for more than a month now and it works flawlessly. Note : the stronger the main wifi signal the better its performance will be.,5
23973,"I've been using it for a month now I'm not happy using it. Its signal retention capacity is very weak. If you use 5Ghz you will get better speed than normal router but you have to stay in the same room and if you use 2.4Ghz you will get speed like normal router but sometimes the speed is less than normal router. I was using another router bridge connection before using it. I will finally say that there is no need to buy it. If you have an old router, use it with a bridge connection, it will s...",3

But given 3 stars because I'm not satisfied with the range. Firstly it losses signal from the router from less distance than my cellphone does.

24062,"It's a good product, the range is way better than it was earlier. It does get a little hot after a few hours of use but I guess that's given as it's directly plugged into the socket and it's not uncommon for devices like these to get warm after use, will only know it's durability after a few weeks of continuous use. Until then it's a good product zi would recommend to people who have big houses and can't afford to have different access points all around the house on their internet connection.",4
24063,Very good and easy to install / configure using app. It extends range for both 2.4 as well 5 GHz Wi-Fi at the same time (I have both).,5
24064,Great product from TP link and I purchased it because I was not receiving WiFi signals in one of my room. You just have to setup this extender using mobile app and you are all set. Great produce and of good quality.,5
24065,"FOR AIRTEL BROADBAND USERS

Pros:-
Nice router better than mobile hotspot .the wifi range is above average . using jio sim i get speed of 8mbps .tether app is also good overall good quality ü•∞

Packaging was not good only the router box itself üòµ
WiFi range could be better",4
24167,"After 60 days of use -
1. Good product for remote area
2. If you have jiofi or other datacard don't waste money on it, it works the same.
3. Don't assume that it will increase the network coverage or speed, speed is totally depends on the network coverage available in your area.
4. If there is low network in your area 2.4 GHz or 5Ghz doesn't matter, you will get slower speed.
5. Range(wifi range) is definitely great and more than any other datacard(I have used jiofi only)
6. Overall Good but ...",4
24168,Works perfectly. 4g speed is super good. Can do work from home by using SIM Card internet VOLte.Also easy to configure and operate. Overall it's a very nice router.,4
24169,I literally had zero covergare inside my house and pleasr its a rural area ...This router exceeded my expectations as the connectivity is very good with around 10 Mbps speed ...I thought it will boost from 1 mbps to 3/4 mbps ...But it is working like a gem ..,5
24170,It is working well in the remote area too. I am writing this after using the product for 6 months. Using LPDA 12 DPI Antenna as external to boost the signal. It's worth of buying if you don't have option to have fiber connection.,5
24171,"After using for a month, i can say that the wifi range is good. The signals are good for BSNL for 3G. 4G of Jio is not upto the mark.
It is good for middle class family to use family wifi with dual band.",3
24172,It was quite helpful as it made my internet speeds faster but it's not s expected. You probably need external antennas and all that. I kept my router in the topmost floor where signal strength is strongest and use it downstairs that way it's usable for me. Plus in my area network is very weak so I can't conclude on the device yet directly. I haven't tried it in a city. So I would say it's quite good.,1

Please don't buy this product because

1. You can't receive any better 4G based internet speed through this router. Complete waste of money. There is no difference between Normal hotspot device and this 4G router.

24240,If you want to buy real gigabit router in low price go for it. Others on this price will tell gigabit but actually they are not. If LAN/ WAN speed is 100 Mbps then what is the use of 1200 router speed? Input is bound to 100 then at most you will get 100 Mbps from router. If you purchase higher band plan (more than 100 Mbps) from your service provider then also it will work because LAN and Wan speed is 1gbps for this router.,5

Ordered it during Big Billions Day and received within 48 hours. Set up was damn easy (15-20 min).

Best way is to connect one Deco to your router via a LAN cable and then connect remaining decos. Do not use Deco as a main router.

I now have 100% wifi connection across my home.

Go for it.",5

Sent several emails too.",1

I have set it up in my duplex house, and every corner we are getting wifi (5GHz), much better than previous 2.4GHz wifi. From child nodes there is little higher latency but if latency is real concern for you instead of wifi you should adopt wired networks entirely.

24919,"Delivery and packaging was on point. Installation was quite seamless. I have a house under 1800 sq ft and the range with two set routers is perfect (go for 3 set if you have a house bigger than 2500 sq ft, even though TP Link claims range upto 3800 sq ft, as that's the max range and can greatly vary depending on walls, furniture etc). No dropping of signal and great speeds at every corner, closing of doors not an issue at all!. I am getting higher speeds though closer to the main router (but ...",5

Easy to set up through the mobile app, even though you need a mobile app and register on the app. Coverage is very good. Though it's expensive for a home use, but useful for me where 4 in a family have to take online class and WFH from different part of the house. Prior to installing, I had a problem with connectivity issues even though I have 150 mbps broadband.",5
24921,"An awesome piece of tech

Easily connected with my Airtel broadband Dlink DSL 224 WPS WiFi router modem in Mysore City. You can view WiFi green light on attached photo.,4
24964,I have 100 mbps net connection when i connect with my base modem through mercusys. speed reduce and gets only 20 mbps because it dose not support dual band frequency.

Also faced disconnection issue with extender even after router working fine. It doesn‚Äôt have rj45 connectivity as its just extender. Suggest you to go for tp link or d link or netgear extender. It costs you more but give more feature as well as better quality,3

24970,Great Product... I have a TP-Link Router which is a good product but although I have no range issue in Ground Floor when it comes to First Floor my Signal is very weak and I am unable to Watch videos only browsing is possible. I brought this extender and plugged into a socket just above the stair case and the signal reception is great and I have no problems anymore.

Initial setup is easy, once we plug in the fiber net cable it will automatically get configured. Since it is a dual-band router, we can get 90% of the same internet speed as per your ISP plan... For me, I have a 150Mbps plan & I'm getting the same speed through 5GHz wifi.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home.",5
25261,"Everything is ok about this product, but I received it in a damaged packaging. See, We are not buying anything cheap, so its packaging should have been better and without a damage. It is the responsibility of Flipkart to take care of this.

My existing triband router performs better than this. the Sad part is that I cant use the deco even as a repeater. It has to be always connected via LAN.

DO NOT buy if you want performance. Moreover Flipkart is giving only replacement? What is the point.",1

The magic is started happening after adding the E4 (satellite mesh and it is connected wirelessly). I am using Airtel as internet provider and the speed is 200 Mbps. I am getting 150+Mbps in each and every corner of the home. You can go for it if you can afford the price.",4

25279,"Great Product. Speacially if you have lan connection across your house then this really works well. I have 5 Decos connected accross the house via LAN and the ethernet backhaul works really well to give consistent speed every where.

If you dont have LAN then mesh connection over wifi may not be as great.",5
25280,"Works as expected. Bought it after much appreciation from my friends who have been using it for over an year now. Only caveat is the Max speeds that you can maxes out at 100mbps, no matter what your internet speed is. So, if you plan to use a internet connection over 100mbps, this is of no use. However, the connection under 100mbps is super stable and reliable. I get around 75-80mbps across the house at all times and even to stream a 4K video, this is more than enough speed.",5

I am running the latest official F/W, so this is not an issue of old F/W.

Even everywhere it mention that C6 have extra internal antenna and not in A6 but it's reverse. A6 have extra internal antenna. A6 have beamforming and onemesh technology too so if anyone confuse between C6 and A6 that one always go with A6.,5
